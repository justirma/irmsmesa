## Engineering ‚å®Ô∏è

Accessibility is HUGE. We should all have understanding on how to make tech better by focusing and paying attention to accessibility. I‚Äôve had it happen to me before where I‚Äôll be designing out a site in Figma and I‚Äôm so deep into making it look _pretty_ or making sure the colors are consistent and I then have to catch myself and ask if what I‚Äôm designing follows principles for accessibility?

[Ben Robertson](https://benrobertson.io/) lays out how we can [design website layouts](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-design-website-layouts-for-screen-readers-347b7b06e9cc) in a way to allow to function with screen readers. I personally had not thought about this use case but it‚Äôs very real. By using structured HTML markup we can create landmarks for the screen reader to follow and allow the experience for that user to flow.

## Mental Models üß†

I‚Äôve always admired people that are able to think fast and make decisions (smart ones) in a quick beat. It‚Äôs definitely an acquired skill and the more experience you have in community the simpler it‚Äôll become.

100PM released a fantastic article around this topic, which I encourage you to read [here](https://www.100productmanagers.com/articles/three-mental-models-for-product-managers) by Aero Wong.

They mention a model named **OODA** that is commonly used by the Navy SEALS to make decisions. A mental model is essentially a framework that we can use daily to visualize an order or plan to follow. It empowers our mind to zoom out of the situation and navigate a path that works for you and the team.

The higher stakes a situations the more difficult it becomes to make decisions. We start to overthink or doubt ourselves. But by using a model that helps ground us in these tough situations can be a total game-changer.
