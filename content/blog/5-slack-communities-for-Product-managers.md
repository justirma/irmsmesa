For new and more season Product Managers it’s never too late to join PM communities to network and to mentor! Below are my top 5 resources for you! I’ve used all of these personally and still use them. I’ve found great value out of each community Which of these have you joined?

## Product School

Product School provides PM training. They have a ton of different campuses all over the US. I found through a few Eventbrite events and attending some of their live streams. They feature PM’s from a ton of different companies — Google, FB, Uber and a many more! Additionally, I found they had both a Slack and Youtube channel which I frequently visit to connect with other PM’s.

- Product School Slack Here is your Slack plug, [click to join.](https://www.productschool.com/slack-community/) Slack is awesome! Every Tuesday there’s an AMA in the workspace. They are different channels for networking, resumes reviews, hiring, tips and advice. Overall, you’ll be getting valuable insight into the industry. I’ve connected with a few people from the Slack channel on LinkedIn and it’s awesome how opne everyone is for both junior and more senior PM’s.

Product Processes Wiki So, I will say this is a fairly recent discovery. I’ve lightly read it but I want to just dedicate like 3–5 hours just diving in and downloading all this knowledge into my brain. If you’re a new PM or maybe the first PM at your company, read the doc below.

Lindsay is amazing. She’s a PM for Indeed and she’s very active on Twitter. She’s reviewed my resume before and given me advice on just being a better PM. She shared her blog with me, which I fell in love with.
