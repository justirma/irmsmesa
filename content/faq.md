## So, you offer paid consulting for remote job seekers and distributed teams?

Yes! My mission is to work closely with remote job seekers or hiring/leaders managing remote teams. For remote job seekers, I offer a plan and support based on your experience and situation to find a remote job that suits you.

For hiring/leadeers and remote teams I help them set the foundational pieces to make their team and culture as healthy as possible to perform in a remote work environment. Think of me like your sidekick.

## I don't know where I need to improve to land a remote job.

No worries! It's hard out there. Let's chat first and get your situation and what you're looking for slated. We'll then collaborate on a plan based on what you're looking for and my experience.

## I don't even know where to start with managing my own remote team.

That's okay, you're in the right place. Through my years of experience working remote in different settings, varying work cultures and all kinds of talented people I have gathered a framework that will support you.

My first step in getting started is understanding your pain points and challenges. From there I'll observe how you and your team communicates and after that we'll brainstorm on how to remedy those pain points.

My goal is help you connect the foundational pieces so that you can carry on your own after our consulting ends. I want to empower you to create the best environment for your team.

## We're drowning with work and we don't have time to sit down, evaluate, document and set up systems.

That's where I'll come in. I'll be that extra support a few hours a month or a week to build a system for your team. My goal is to come in for 2 or 3 months and help you turn the ship around.

## Do you offer an initial consultation call?

I sure do. It's free, 30 mins and we'll discuss how we can get going. This is also the perfect time to ensure you and I are the right fit to work together.

## What's the best way to reach you?

You may email me [here](mailto:techbizdesign@justirma.com)

## What's this community thing you speak of?

Haha! Yes, so I wanted to bring us remote workers, managers, entrepreneurs into one space. We'd love to see you join, find our community [here](https://discord.gg/Jaz2p6N). All we ask is to please be respectful to others and not to spam or overly self-promote.
