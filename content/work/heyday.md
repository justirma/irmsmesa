## Introducing your POC co-working platform

![HeyDay website landing page](/heyday_landing.png)

HeyDay is a passion project of mine. As a triple minority it can be nervewracking entering new spaces where I don't see people that look like me.

So, HeyDay was born. I started to not only realize that finding safe spaces is difficult but I also realized that I needed more accountability for my scheduling and getting work done. It's hard, right?

Days become short. Hours pass. We get lazy.

## Who's HeyDay for?

If you're an entrepreneur, workaholic, freelancer, maker, founder - really anyone. I'd love for you to check out HeyDay.

What is it? You'll be able to bring 1 task or goal you've been dying to accomplish and join a few other POC folks in a virtual setting and set yourself accountable to get to working on that task/goal. It's a great way to itentionally cross off important items from your list weekly.

## Give a look. Come join us.

If this sounds like something you'd like to check out, visit us here and sign up for our next co-working meetup! Again, it's virtual - so you can do this from the comfort of your home, a coffee-shop, outdoors, anywhere.

I'll catch you there.
