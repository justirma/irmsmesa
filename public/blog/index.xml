      <description>So you‚Äôre having trouble with meetings, huh?
It‚Äôs a problem a lot of us have. I have yet to meet 1 person who has meetings, scheduling them, etc. to work perfectly. It&amp;rsquo;s honestly sometimes even worse in a remote setting because I can just pop over to your calendar and pick anytime I please to meet with you.
In the meantime, while that is being figured out, here is a great post by Flexiple on how you can schedule meetings like a BOSS.</description>

      <description>Building a newsletter is easy, right? That‚Äôs subjective.
Over the last few weeks I‚Äôve been on a mission. A mission to build. Build something, anything! I went back and forth with ideas I have jotted in my Notion.so app. Some solved problems others were just silly and fun so I had a great mix of varied ideas.
In the end, I settled on seeing and building out 2 ideas. This is the story about the first one, I‚Äôm calling her onePodcast.</description>

      <title>empowering your Engineering teams</title>

      <description>I‚Äôve received 1:1 messages from engineers asking if they can go into our project management tool and enter in a task. Of course, I say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and also remind them to enter tasks in immediately if it‚Äôll help them unblock their work. This is one way we can empower engineering teams to perform autonomously.
As a Dev Manager, Scrum Master, Product Manager &amp;amp; CTO (I know, there are a few more roles I‚Äôm missing) actively practicing ways to build trust and confidence in your engineers is crucial to the health of your team as well as the product.</description>

      <description>Let me start with this: props to the person who submitted this question on #AskWiP! It‚Äôs a question that many have when they‚Äôre starting to build product skills and for good reason‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääopen source product management opportunities are difficult to find. Unlike software engineering, where you‚Äôll find Github projects or non-profit organizations actively looking for volunteers at any level to come on board and contribute, open source projects that look for volunteer PMs are almost non-existent.</description>
