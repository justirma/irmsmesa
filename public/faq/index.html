<h2 id="so-you-offer-paid-consulting-for-remote-job-seekers-and-distributed-teams">So, you offer paid consulting for remote job seekers and distributed teams?</h2>

<p>Yes! My mission is to work closely with remote job seekers or hiring/leaders managing remote teams. For remote job seekers, I offer a plan and support based on your experience and situation to find a remote job that suits you.</p>

<p>For hiring/leadeers and remote teams I help them set the foundational pieces to make their team and culture as healthy as possible to perform in a remote work environment. Think of me like your sidekick.</p>

<h2 id="i-don-t-know-where-i-need-to-improve-to-land-a-remote-job">I don&rsquo;t know where I need to improve to land a remote job.</h2>

<p>No worries! It&rsquo;s hard out there. Let&rsquo;s chat first and get your situation and what you&rsquo;re looking for slated. We&rsquo;ll then collaborate on a plan based on what you&rsquo;re looking for and my experience.</p>

<h2 id="i-don-t-even-know-where-to-start-with-managing-my-own-remote-team">I don&rsquo;t even know where to start with managing my own remote team.</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s okay, you&rsquo;re in the right place. Through my years of experience working remote in different settings, varying work cultures and all kinds of talented people I have gathered a framework that will support you.</p>

<p>My first step in getting started is understanding your pain points and challenges. From there I&rsquo;ll observe how you and your team communicates and after that we&rsquo;ll brainstorm on how to remedy those pain points.</p>

<p>My goal is help you connect the foundational pieces so that you can carry on your own after our consulting ends. I want to empower you to create the best environment for your team.</p>

<h2 id="we-re-drowning-with-work-and-we-don-t-have-time-to-sit-down-evaluate-document-and-set-up-systems">We&rsquo;re drowning with work and we don&rsquo;t have time to sit down, evaluate, document and set up systems.</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll come in. I&rsquo;ll be that extra support a few hours a month or a week to build a system for your team. My goal is to come in for 2 or 3 months and help you turn the ship around.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-offer-an-initial-consultation-call">Do you offer an initial consultation call?</h2>

<p>I sure do. It&rsquo;s free, 30 mins and we&rsquo;ll discuss how we can get going. This is also the perfect time to ensure you and I are the right fit to work together.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-best-way-to-reach-you">What&rsquo;s the best way to reach you?</h2>

<p>You may email me <a href="mailto:techbizdesign@justirma.com" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<h2 id="what-s-this-community-thing-you-speak-of">What&rsquo;s this community thing you speak of?</h2>

<p>Haha! Yes, so I wanted to bring us remote workers, managers, entrepreneurs into one space. We&rsquo;d love to see you join, find our community <a href="https://discord.gg/Jaz2p6N" target="_blank">here</a>. All we ask is to please be respectful to others and not to spam or overly self-promote.</p>
