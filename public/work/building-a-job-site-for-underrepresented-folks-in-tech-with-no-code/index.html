            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/work/building-a-job-site-for-underrepresented-folks-in-tech-with-no-code/">TooBusy, a job site | No Code Build</a></h2>

            

            <div class="post-content">
                

<p>I started to reflect on my journey applying to jobs, interviewing, getting rejections and accepting offers. I came to understand that outside of being referred by a friend or a connection or being spammed by random recuriers trying to bring you on for a skill that&rsquo;s not even on your LinkedIn profile, usually job seekers have will apply directly on the job posting.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s think about this. A company, hiring manager or HR will draft up a job description with their &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; sometimes &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; candidate. They&rsquo;ll make it live using some ATS (Applicant Tracking System) tool out there then open the gates to applicants to come rushing to apply.</p>

<p>And sometimes that&rsquo;s it. The hiring team just waits.</p>

<p>I thought about this long and hard and began thinking, why isn&rsquo;t there more pressure on recruiters and hiring managers to seek those applicants instead? I&rsquo;m not saying companies don&rsquo;t do this at all but majority of them do. They&rsquo;ll use Greenhouse and cross-post the job across Indeed, LinkedIn, Google Jobs, etc. But is there time alloted to searching for applicants? Seeking applicants who fit the description? I think at it&rsquo;s core it&rsquo;s about accessibility. Not everyone knows where, when and how to find certain jobs but what if there was 1 single site where applicants were aggregated for hiring companies and recruiters?</p>

<h2 id="who-s-this-for">Who&rsquo;s this for?</h2>

<p>Two core audiences:</p>

<ol>
<li>This app is for job seekers with less than 2 years of experience and are on the hunt for a job in tech can share there work and get connected with recruiters.</li>
<li>This is also for recruiters to get notified every week with new seekers and for them to connect with seekers for interviews.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-s-this-for">What’s this for?</h2>

<p>This is for recruiters to find job seekers and hire diverse talent. It&rsquo;s also a place where job seekers with &lt;2 years can showcase their work and let recruiters know they&rsquo;re actively seeking work.</p>

<h2 id="building-the-design-and-setting-up">Building the Design and Setting up</h2>

<p>I toyed with the idea of building this myself with React and Node but then I didn&rsquo;t. Mostly because I wanted to stand up the site quickly and begin to engage communities and bring them on board to apply as seekers.</p>

<p>I needed a tool to handle data. One of the easiest ways to turn a spreadsheet into a site is using <a href="https://table2site.com" target="_blank">Table2Site</a></p>

<p>I hooked up Table2Site (they make their setup super simple) with Airtable using a base for this project. Table2Site allows you to clone their available templates, so I did that and started to populate the content, design, colors, copy, etc.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>You can check out TooBusy, <a href="https:/toobusy.co" target="_blank">here</a> and apply to become a seeker!</p>

<p>Bring on more seekers and start getting the seekers shared with hiring companies and recruiters.</p>
